# btd6AutoFarmer
A python script to automate the clearing of expert maps for collection events

The current code requires double-cash mode, but hey if anyone wants to work on helping me come up with an easy clear (without banana farms/selling of units) for the various maps, I would gladly include a more universal variant.

Packages to be installed:
pyautogui
pydirectinput
open-cv (It runs way too slow without)

Setting required:
Turn off auto advance for rounds
Resolution at 1680x1050 and not fullscreen
Monkey knowledge following this: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ht1jk5pn6Ac
(Will add more if I remember any)

The code is also really messy and I probably will split it into more files once I find the time, probably when I get less lazy during the next collection event.
