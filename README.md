# btd6AutoFarmer
A python script to automate the clearing of expert maps for collection events

The current code requires double-cash mode, but hey if anyone wants to work on helping me come up with an easy clear (without banana farms/selling of units) for the various maps, I would gladly include a more universal variant.

Packages to be installed:
pyautogui;
pydirectinput;
open-cv (It runs way too slow without)

Setting required:
Turn off auto advance for rounds;
Resolution at 1680x1050 and not fullscreen;
Monkey knowledge following this: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ht1jk5pn6Ac ;
(Will add more if I remember any)

Things to do:

Add an async code to catch level ups and auto advance

Tidy the code and split it into different files to make it easier to edit
